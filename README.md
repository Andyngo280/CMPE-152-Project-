# CMPE-152-Project

Our team will be working on a compiler project throughout the semester. The goal is to create a working compiler for a subset of the Pascal programming language. We will be able to write, compile, and execute programs written in an invented or chosen language. We will need to develop our own grammar for this language. We will generate a compiler for the language using the ANTLR compiler-compiler.
